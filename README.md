# Introduction

Resource Aggregator for Open Distributed Infrastructure Management \(ODIM™\) is a modular, open framework for simplified management and orchestration of distributed physical infrastructure.

Resource Aggregator for ODIM comprises the following two key components:

-    The resource aggregation function \(the resource aggregator\):

     The resource aggregation function is the single point of contact between the northbound clients and the southbound infrastructure. Its primary function is to build and maintain a central resource inventory. It exposes Redfish-compliant APIs to allow northbound infrastructure management systems to:
     -  Get a unified view of the southbound compute, local storage, and Ethernet switch fabrics available in the resource inventory
     -   Gather crucial configuration information about southbound resources
     -   Manipulate groups of resources in a single action
     -   Listen to similar events from multiple southbound resources

 - One or more plugins:

   The plugins abstract, translate, and expose southbound resource information to the resource aggregator through RESTful APIs. Resource Aggregator for ODIM supports:

    -  Generic Redfish plugin for ODIM (The GRF plugin): This plugin can be used for any Redfish-compliant device
    -  Dell plugin for ODIM: Plugin for managing Dell servers
   -  Plugin for unmanaged racks \(URP): This plugin acts as a resource manager for unmanaged racks.
   -  Cisco ACI plugin: Plugin for managing Cisco ACI servers
   -  Integration of additional third-party plugins
   
   Resource Aggregator for ODIM allows third parties to easily develop and integrate their plugins into its framework. For more information, see [Resource Aggregator for Open Distributed Infrastructure Management™ Plugin Developer's Guide](https://github.com/ODIM-Project/ODIM/blob/development/plugin-redfish/README.md).
   
   

## Resource Aggregator for ODIM deployment overview

Deploying Resource Aggregator for ODIM in a data center involves installing the following microservices on one or more machines:

-   Kubernetes microservices
-   The resource aggregator microservices:
    - API
    - Account-session
    - Aggregation
    - Events
    - Fabrics
    - Managers
    - Systems
    - Tasks
    - Update
    - Telemetry
-   The plugin microservices such as the Dell plugin, URP, and additional third-party plugins
-   Third-party services such as Kafka, etcd, Zookeeper, and Redis

These microservices can be deployed as portable, light-weight Docker containers. The containerized services are orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes—an open-source container orchestration platform that helps to automate, scale, and manage a containerized application. For more information on Kubernetes and its architecture, see [https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

The following diagram illustrates how Resource Aggregator for ODIM is deployed and used in a Kubernetes environment. It indicates a cluster with three controller nodes (Node 1, Node 2 and Node 3) and that any additional worker nodes can be added into the cluster.

![Deployment diagram](docs/images/odim_deployment.png)

To deploy Resource Aggregator for ODIM, you will require:

-   One virtual machine \(VM\) or a physical machine called the deployment node to deploy Kubernetes and Resource Aggregator for ODIM microservices. You can deploy the Resource Aggregator for ODIM microservices using the odim-controller command-line utility and use commands to:
    -   Set up the Docker environment
    -   Set up a Kubernetes cluster
    -   Deploy the containerized Resource Aggregator for ODIM microservices and third-party services on the Kubernetes cluster nodes
    -   Manage the Resource Aggregator for ODIM deployment
    
- One or more physical or virtual machines called cluster nodes where the containerized Resource Aggregator for ODIM microservices and third-party services are deployed as pods.
  The cluster nodes include controller and additional worker nodes to share the extra load. The controller node in a cluster also functions as a worker node. A cluster can have either one or three controller nodes. A cluster with three controller nodes provides a High Availability \(HA\) environment. In addition, you can add worker nodes into the cluster to scale up the resources and the services.

  Each controller node has the following components:

  -   An underlying Ubuntu OS platform
  -   The Docker container engine
  -   The resource aggregator and the plugin microservice pods
  -   The infrastructure pods containing all the third-party services
  -   Kubelet, Kubeproxy, and the Kubernetes control plane comprising the API server, Scheduler, and the Controller-Manager

  For more information on these Kubernetes components, see  [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/).


The following diagram is a logical representation of each controller node in a Kubernetes cluster.

![Cluster node](docs/images/odim_cluster.png)

The northbound management and orchestration systems access the Resource Aggregator for ODIM services through a virtual IP address \(VIP\) configured on the Kubernetes cluster using Keepalived. Communication between Resource Aggregator for ODIM and the southbound infrastructure happens through the same VIP.

Nginx acts as a reverse-proxy for the cluster nodes. Keepalived and Nginx together help in implementing HA of the Resource Aggregator for ODIM services on the cluster nodes for both northbound management applications and southbound infrastructure to access.

## Deployment considerations

Consider the following while deploying Resource Aggregator for ODIM:

-   A deployment node is required to deploy Kubernetes and Resource Aggregator for ODIM microservices.

-   The following two deployment configurations are supported:

    -  One-node cluster configuration:
	   This configuration has only one cluster node that also functions as a worker node. It does not support scaling of the Resource Aggregator for ODIM resources and services—you cannot add worker nodes in a one-node cluster.

    -  Three-node cluster configuration:
	   This configuration has three cluster nodes that also function as worker nodes for sharing the extra load. It provides HA environment by allowing the scaling of the Resource Aggregator for ODIM resources and services—you can add worker nodes and increase the number of service instances running in a three-node cluster.
    
    To convert an existing one-node cluster into a three-node cluster, you must reset the one-node deployment first and then modify the required parameters in the odim-controller configuration file.
    
    <blockquote> NOTE:  Resetting the existing deployment clears all data related to it. </blockquote>

-   Controller nodes of a Kubernetes cluster must not be removed.

-   The GRF plugin is not meant to be used in a production environment. Use it as reference while developing third-party plugins.

-   Scaling of the third-party services—Kafka and Redis clusters is not supported.

-   There must be at least one instance of a resource aggregator service and a plugin service running in the cluster. The maximum number of instances of a resource aggregator service and a plugin service that are allowed to run in a cluster is 10.

        ```
        mkdir ~/helm
        ```

        ```
        cd ~/helm
        ```

    2. Fetch the latest Helm installation script.

        ```
        curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | /bin/bash
        ```

    3. Change permissions of the Helm installation script file.

        ```
        chmod 0700 get_helm.sh
        ```

    4. Run the Helm installation script.

        ```
        /bin/bash get_helm.sh
        ```


## Pulling the Docker images of all the Kubernetes microservices

1. Run the following command on the deployment node to pull each Docker image in the following table:

   ```
   docker pull <imagename>:<version>
   ```
   
   Example: `docker pull quay.io/calico/cni:v3.19.2`
   
   The following table lists the details of all Docker images of the Kubernetes microservices to be pulled:
   
   |Docker image name|Version|Docker image file name|
   |-----|----|-----|
   |k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver|v1.21.5 |k8s.gcr.io_kube-apiserver.tar |
   |k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager|v1.21.5 |k8s.gcr.io_kube-controller-manager.tar |
   |k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy| v1.21.5 |k8s.gcr.io_kube-proxy.tar |
   |k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler| v1.21.5 |k8s.gcr.io_kube-scheduler.tar |
   |quay.io/calico/node| v3.19.2 |quay.io_calico_node.tar |

   |k8s.gcr.io/dns/k8s-dns-node-cache|1.17.1 |k8s.gcr.io_dns_k8s-dns-node-cache.tar |
   |k8s.gcr.io/pause|3.4.1 |k8s.gcr.io_pause.tar |
   |nginx|1.19 |nginx.tar |
   |k8s.gcr.io/coredns/coredns|v1.8.0 |k8s.gcr.io_coredns_coredns.tar |
   |quay.io/coreos/etcd|v3.4.13 |quay.io_coreos_etcd.tar |
   |k8s.gcr.io/cpa/cluster-proportional-autoscaler-amd64|1.8.3 |k8s.gcr.io_cpa_cluster-proportional-autoscaler-amd64.tar |
   | lachlanevenson/k8s-helm                              |v3.2.3 |lachlanevenson_k8s-helm.tar |
   
2. Verify the images are successfully pulled using the following command.
   ```
   docker images
   ```
   
   You get an output similar to the following sample:
   
   <img src="docs/images/kubernetes_images.png" alt="Cluster node" style="zoom:80%;" />
   
3. Save each Docker image to a tar archive using the following command:

    ```
    docker save -o <Docker image file name> <Docker image name>
    ```
    Example: `docker save -o quay.io_calico_node.tar quay.io/calico/node` 

4. Copy each saved tar archive to a directory called `kubernetes_images` on the deployment node. 

   For example:`cp /home/bruce/*.tar /home/bruce/kubernetes_images`

   <blockquote> IMPORTANT: When deploying ODIMRA, update the 'kubernetesImagePath' parameter in 'kube_deploy_nodes.yaml' file with the path of the 'kubernetes_images' directory you choose in this step. The images are automatically installed on all cluster nodes after deployment. </blockquote>

   <blockquote>The 'kube_deploy_nodes.yaml' file is the configuration file used by odim-controller to set up a Kubernetes cluster and to deploy the Resource Aggregator for ODIM services.</blockquote>
   
   <blockquote>
       NOTE: Verify the permissions of the archived tar files of the Docker images; the privilege of all files must be 'user:docker'.</blockquote>


## Building Docker images of all the services

1. Run the following commands on the deployment node:
   1. ```
      git clone https://github.com/ODIM-Project/ODIM.git
      ```
      
   2. ```
      cd ODIM
      ```
      
   3. ```
      export ODIMRA_USER_ID=2021
      ```
	   
   4. ```
      export ODIMRA_GROUP_ID=2021
      ```
      
   5. ```
      ./build_images.sh
	   ```
	   
	6. ```
	   sudo docker images
	   ```
	   If the images are built successfully, you get an output similar to the following sample:
	   
	   <img src="docs/images/odimra_images.png" style="zoom:95%;"   >
	   
	7. Pull the reloader and busybox images using the following commands:
	   
	   ```
	   docker pull stakater/reloader:v0.0.76
	   
	   docker pull busybox:1.33
	   ```
	
2. Save all Docker images in the following table to a tar archive using the following command:

    ```
    docker save -o <image_name.tar> <image_name>:<version>
    ```
    Example: `docker save -o api.tar api:3.0`

    | **Docker image name** | **Version** | **Docker image bundle name** |

3. To install the Docker images of all services on the cluster nodes, create a directory called `odimra_images` on the deployment node and copy each tar archive to this directory. 
    For example: `cp /home/bruce/ODIM/*.tar /home/bruce/odimra_images`

    <blockquote> IMPORTANT: while deploying ODIMRA, update the 'odimraImagePath' parameter in 'kube_deploy_nodes.yaml' file with the path of the 'odimra_images' directory you choose in this step. The images are automatically installed on all cluster nodes after deployment. </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
        NOTE: The 'kube_deploy_nodes.yaml' file is the configuration file used by odim-controller to set up a Kubernetes cluster and to deploy the Resource Aggregator for ODIM services. </blockquote>



## Updating additional package versions

While deploying Resource Aggregator for ODIM, verify the versions of the following packages and update them if required.

<blockquote> Note: Verify the Keepalived and Nginx package versions only in case of a three-node cluster deployment. </blockquote>

#### linux-headers

1. Enter the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-cache madison linux-headers-5.8.0-63-generic
   ```

   <blockquote>NOTE: If the above command fails with the error message, N: Unable to locate package linuxheaders-
   5.8.0-63-generic, package version has changed. Proceed with further steps to find the latest version.</blockquote>
   
2. Enter the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-cache search --names-only "linux-headers-[0-9.-]*-generic" | tail -5 | sort -r
   ```

3. Enter the following command to verify if the first entry in the output list is present in the cache.

   ```
   sudo apt-cache madison <package_name>
   ```

   Example for `<package_name>` is `linux-headers-5.8.0-63-generic`

4. In case of a version mismatch, update the latest version of `linux-header` package in:

    `~/ODIM/odim-controller/odimra/group_vars/all/requirements.yaml`

#### Keepalived

1. Enter the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-cache madison keepalived
   ```

2. Verify if the latest version is `keepalived=1:2.0.19-2`.

3. In case of a version mismatch, update the latest version of the `Keepalived` package in:
   `~/ODIM/odim-controller/odimra/group_vars/all/requirements.yaml`

#### Nginx

1. Enter the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-cache madison nginx
   ```

2. Verify if the latest version is `nginx=1.18.0-0ubuntu1.2`.

3. In case of a version mismatch, update the latest version of the `Nginx` package in:
   `~/ODIM/odim-controller/odimra/group_vars/all/requirements.yaml`



## Generating encrypted passwords for nodes and Redis

Encrypting passwords of the local non-root user on the Kubernetes cluster nodes and Redis database makes the deployment process non-interactive. If the encrypted password is not available during deployment, you are prompted to enter the password for the first time.

Resource Aggregator for ODIM uses the odim-vault tool to encrypt and decrypt passwords.


1. On the deployment node, navigate to ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts.

    ```
    cd ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts
    ```

1. Build the odim-vault tool.
   ```
   go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o odim-vault odim-vault.go
   ```

2. Enter a random string in a file called odimVaultKeyFile and save it.

    ```
    vi odimVaultKeyFile
    ```

    The entered string acts as the odim-vault crypto key. It is required for encrypting and decrypting the local user password of the Kubernetes cluster nodes.

3. To encode the entered odim-vault crypto key, run the following command: 

    ```
    ./odim-vault -encode ~/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/odimVaultKeyFile
    ```

    **Result**: odimVaultKeyFile contains the encoded odim-vault master key.

4. Change the file permissions of odimVaultKeyFile.

    ```
    chmod 0400 /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/odimVaultKeyFile
    ```

5. Enter the password of the default non-root user \(that was set across all cluster nodes initially\) in plain text in a file called `nodePasswordFile`. 

    ```
    vi nodePasswordFile
    ```

6. Save the file. 

8. To encrypt the password, run the following command: 

    ```
    ./odim-vault -key ~/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/odimVaultKeyFile -encrypt /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/nodePasswordFile
    ```

    **Result**: `nodePasswordFile` contains the encrypted node password.

9. Change the file permissions of `nodePasswordFile`.

    ```
    chmod 0400 /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/nodePasswordFile
    ```

10. Enter the password of the Redis in-memory database in plain text in a file called `redisInMemoryPasswordFile`.  

   ```
   vi redisInMemoryPasswordFile
   ```

11. Save the file.

12. To encrypt the password, run the following command: 

    ```
    ./odim-vault -key ~/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/odimVaultKeyFile -encrypt /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/redisInMemoryPasswordFile
    ```

    **Result**: `redisInMemoryPasswordFile` contains the encrypted node password.

13. Change the file permissions of `redisInMemoryPasswordFile`.

    ```
    chmod 0400 /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/redisInMemoryPasswordFile
    ```

14. Enter the password of the Redis on-disk database in plain text in a file called `redisOnDiskPasswordFile`. 

    ```
    vi redisOnDiskPasswordFile
    ```

15. Save the file.

16. To encrypt the password, run the following command: 

    ```
    ./odim-vault -key ~/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/odimVaultKeyFile -encrypt /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/redisOnDiskPasswordFile 
    ```

    **Result**: `redisOnDiskPasswordFile` contains the encrypted node password.

17. Change the file permissions of `redisOnDiskPasswordFile`.

    ```
    chmod 0400 /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/\
    scripts/redisOnDiskPasswordFile 
    ```

## Log path for odim-controller

You can provide a desired file path for the odim-controller logs by setting ODIM_CONTROLLER_LOG_PATH environment variable. Upon the execution of odim-controller, the log file will then be stored as `{ODIM_CONTROLLER_LOG_PATH}/odim-controller.log`.

If the environment variable is not set, the log file will be stored in the current directory where odim-controller was executed.

Upon each execution of odim-controller, the following information is logged:

- Start time and end time of the execution
- User and the groups, user belongs to
- Options passed to odim-controller
- Complete output of the operation



# Deploying Resource Aggregator for ODIM and the Plugins

Topics covered in this section include:

1. [Deploying the resource aggregator services](#deploying-the-resource-aggregator-services)
2. [Deploying the Unmanaged Rack Plugin \(URP\)](#deploying-the-unmanaged-rack-plugin)
3. [Deploying the Dell plugin](#deploying-the-dell-plugin)
4. [Deploying the Cisco ACI plugin](#deploying-the-cisco-aci-plugin)
5. [Adding a plugin into the Resource Aggregator for ODIM framework](#adding-a-plugin-into-the-resource-aggregator-for-odim-framework)

## Deploying the resource aggregator services

**Prerequisites**

Ensure all the [Predeployment procedures](#predeployment-procedures) are complete.

1. Perform the following steps to update the odim-controller configuration file: 
   1. Navigate to `~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts` on the deployment node.

      ```
      cd ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts
      ```

   2. Copy content from the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml.tmpl` file to the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file by running the following command:

      ```
      cp kube_deploy_nodes.yaml.tmpl kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
      ```
      
   3. Edit the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file. 

      ```
      vi kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
      ```

      The `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file is the configuration file used by odim-controller to set up a Kubernetes cluster and to deploy the Resource Aggregator for ODIM services.

      <blockquote> NOTE: Do not change the format of the content in this file. Doing so might interrupt the Resource Aggregator for ODIM deployment process. </blockquote>

      When you open the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file for the first time, it looks like the following (for a three node cluster):

      For information on each parameter in this configuration file, see [Odim-controller configuration parameters](#odim-controller-configuration-parameters).

   4. Update the following mandatory parameters in the above configuration file:

      - `httpProxy` (if your environment is behind a proxy)

      - `httpsProxy` (if your environment is behind a proxy)

      - `noProxy` (if your environment is behind a proxy)

      - `deploymentID`

      - `nodePasswordFilePath`

      - `redisInMemoryPasswordFilePath`

      - `redisOnDiskPasswordFilePath`
   
      - `nodes` (details of the single deployment node or the cluster nodes based on the type of your deployment)
   
        For three node deployment:
   
        - hostnames of node 1, node 2, and node 3

        - IP addresses of node 1, node 2, and node 3
   
        - username of node 1, node 2, and node 3
      
        - Priority values of node 1, node 2, and node 3 (mandatory if `haDeploymentEnabled` is set to true)
      
      - `nwPreference` (default value is ipv4. If `dualStack` based deployment is selected, resource aggregator API service can be reached via both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses)
      
      - `odimControllerSrcPath`
      
      - `odimVaultKeyFilePath`

2. Set up a Kubernetes cluster by performing the following procedure: 
    1. Navigate to `odim-controller/scripts` on the deployment node: 

        ```
        cd ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts
        ```

    2. Run the following command on the deployment node: 

        ```
        python3 odim-controller.py --deploy \
        kubernetes --config /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/\
        scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
        ```

    3. Enable the non-root user to access the Kubernetes command-line tool \(kubectl\) on the cluster nodes. Run the following commands on each cluster node:

        ```
		mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
        ```
        
        ```
		sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
        ```
        
        ```
		sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
        ```
    
    4. Verify that the Kubernetes pods are up and running in the cluster nodes. Run the following command on each cluster node:
    
        ```
		kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide
        ```
    
        Example output:
    
        <img src="docs/images/kuberenetes_pods_verification.png" alt="screenshot" style="zoom:60%;" /> 


3. Deploy the resource aggregator services: 

    1. Log in to the deployment node and run the following command: 

        ```
        python3 odim-controller.py --deploy \
        odimra --config /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/\
        scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
        ```

        All the resource aggregator services and the third-party services are successfully deployed.

    2. Log in to each cluster node, run the following command on each cluster node to verify all deployed services are running successfully. 

        ```
        kubectl get pods -n odim -o wide
        ```

        Example output:

        <img src="docs/images/all_services_verification.png" alt="screenshot" style="zoom:55%;" />
        If the services are not successfully deployed, reset the deployment and try deploying again. 
        To reset, run the following command:

        ```
        python3 odim-controller.py --reset odimra --config \
        /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml \
        --ignore-errors
        ```

        For a three-node cluster deployment, resetting deployment removes the virtual IP configured through Keepalived. After resetting the deployment, restart the Keepalived service. Also, ensure the parameters in the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml `are not NULL. Update such parameters to `""` or as per your requirement.
        **For example**: After resetting the deployment, update the odimCertsPath parameter to `""` or to your actual certificate path in the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file. 
    <blockquote>NOTE: Save the RootServiceUUID in the kube_deploy_nodes.yaml file in the path ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml.
            If the services are not successfully deployed and you want to reset the deployment, you can use the saved RootServiceUUID.</blockquote>	


4. Perform HTTP GET on `/redfish/v1` using the following curl command on your deployment node. 

   <blockquote>
   IMPORTANT: Before running curl commands, unset http and https proxies, check if you have set proxy configuration. If yes, set "no_proxy" using the following commands: 
</blockquote>

   ```
   unset https_proxy
   ```
   
   ```
   unset http_proxy
   ```
   
   ```
   export no_proxy="127.0.0.1,localhost,\
   localhost.localdomain,10.96.0.0/12,\

   ```
   
   Verify that all the resource aggregator services are listed in the JSON response body by running the following curl command:
   
   ```
   curl -s --cacert \ 
   {path_of_rootCA.crt} \ 
   'https://{odim_host}:{port}/redfish/v1' -k
   ```

 - Replace `{path_of_rootCA.crt}` with the path specified for the odimCertsPath parameter in the kube\_deploy\_nodes.yaml file - `<odimcertsPath>/rootCA.crt`. The `rootCA.crt` file is required for secure SSL communication.
   
  - {odim_host} is the virtual IP address of the Kubernetes cluster.
   
    <blockquote>
     NOTE: For a single node cluster configuration, {odim_host} is the ip address of master node. For a three node cluster configuration, to use FQDN as `{odim_host}`, ensure that FQDN is configured to the virtual IP address in the `/etc/hosts` file or in the DNS server.
     </blockquote>
   
  - {port} is the API server port configured in Nginx. Default port is `30080`. If you have changed the default port, use that as the port.

     The following JSON response is returned:

## Deploying the Unmanaged Rack Plugin

**Prerequisites**

Kubernetes cluster is set up and the resource aggregator is successfully deployed.

1. Create a directory called `plugins` on the deployment node.
   
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/plugins
   ```
   
4. In the `plugins` directory, create a directory called `urplugin`.
   ```
   mkdir ~/plugins/urplugin
   ```

3. Log in to the deployment node and generate an encrypted password of Resource Aggregator for ODIM to be used in the urplugin-config.yaml file. 

    Run the following command and copy the output:

    ```
    echo -n '<ODIMRA password>' |openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -inkey <odimCertsPath>/odimra_rsa.private -pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:oaep -pkeyopt rsa_oaep_md:sha512|openssl base64 -A
    ```

    In this command, replace:

    -  <ODIMRA password> with the password of Resource Aggregator for ODIM \(default administrator account password\).
    -  <odimCertsPath> with the path you specified for the `<odimCertsPath>` parameter in the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file.

    Example output:

    ```

17. [Add the Dell plugin into the Resource Aggregator for ODIM framework](#adding-a-plugin-into-the-resource-aggregator-for-odim-framework). 



## Deploying the Lenovo plugin

**Prerequisites**

Kubernetes cluster is set up and the resource aggregator is successfully deployed.

1. Create a directory called `plugins` on the deployment node.

       mkdir plugins

2. In the `plugins` directory, create a directory called `lenovoplugin`.

       mkdir ~/plugins/lenovoplugin

3. On the deployment node, copy the Lenovo plugin configuration file and the hook script to `~/plugins/lenovoplugin`.

   ```
   cp ~/ODIM/odim-controller/helmcharts/lenovoplugin/lenovoplugin-config.yaml ~/plugins/lenovoplugin
   ```

   ```
   cp ~/ODIM/odim-controller/helmcharts/lenovoplugin/lenovoplugin.sh ~/plugins/lenovoplugin
   ```

4. Open the Lenovo plugin configuration YAML file. 

       vi ~/plugins/lenovoplugin/lenovoplugin-config.yaml

   **Sample lenovoplugin-config.yaml file:**

   ```
   lenovoplugin:
     hostname: knode1
     eventListenerNodePort: 30089
     lenovoPluginRootServiceUUID: 7a38b735-8b9f-48a0-b3e7-e5a180567d37
     username: admin
     password: sTfTyTZFvNj5zU5Tt0TfyDYU-ye3_ZqTMnMIj-LAeXaa8vCnBqq8Ga7zV6ZdfqQCdSAzmaO5AJxccD99UHLVlQ==
     lbHost: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
     lbPort: 30089
     logPath: /var/log/lenovoplugin_logs
   ```

5. Update the following parameters in the plugin configuration file: 

   - **lbHost**: IP address of the cluster node where the Lenovo plugin will be installed for one node cluster configuration. For three node cluster configuration,  lbHost is the virtual IP address configured in Nginx and Keepalived.

   - **lbPort**: Default port is 30089. for one node cluster configuration. For three node cluster configuration,lbport must be assigned with a free port (preferably above 45000) available on all cluster nodes. This port is used as nginx proxy port for the plugin.

     <blockquote>Note: The lbport is used as proxy port for eventlistenernodeport, which is used for subscribing to events.</blockquote>

   - **lenovoPluginRootServiceUUID**: RootServiceUUID to be used by the Lenovo plugin service.  Generate a new UUID by executing the command `uuidgen`.

   Other parameters can have default values. Optionally, you can update them with values based on your requirements. For more information on each parameter, see [Plugin configuration parameters](#plugin-configuration-parameters).

6. Generate the Helm package for the Lenovo plugin on the deployment node.

   1. Navigate to `odim-controller/helmcharts/lenovoplugin`.

          cd ~/ODIM/odim-controller/helmcharts/lenovoplugin

   2. Run the following command to create `lenovoplugin` Helm package at `~/plugins/lenovoplugin`:

          helm package lenovoplugin -d ~/plugins/lenovoplugin

      The Helm package for the Lenovo plugin is created in the tgz format.

7. Save the Lenovo plugin Docker image on the deployment node at `~/plugins/lenovoplugin`.

       docker save lenovoplugin:1.0 -o ~/plugins/lenovoplugin/lenovoplugin.tar

8. Navigate to the` ODIM` directory.

   ```
   cd ODIM
   ```

9. Copy the proxy configuration file `install/templates/lenovoplugin_proxy_server.conf.j2` to `~/plugins/lenovoplugin`.

   ```
   cp install/templates/lenovoplugin_proxy_server.conf.j2 ~/plugins/lenovoplugin
   ```

   **Important**: Do NOT change the value of any parameter in this file. 

10. Navigate to the `/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts` directory on the deployment node.

      ```
      cd ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts
      ```

11. Open the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file.

        vi kube_deploy_nodes.yaml

12. Specify values for the following parameters in the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file: 

    | Parameter                    | Value                                                        |

    <blockquote>
        NOTE: To generate a base64 encoded string of `{odim_username:odim_password}`, run the following command:</blockquote>
   
    ```
   echo -n '{odim_username}:{odim_password}' | base64 -w0
    ```
   
   Default username is `admin` and default password is `Od!m12$4`.
   Replace `{base64_encoded_string_of_[odim_username:odim_password]}` with the generated base64 encoded string in the curl command. You will receive:
   
    - An HTTP `202 Accepted` status code.
    - A link of the executed task. Performing a `GET` operation on this link displays the task monitor associated with this operation in the response header.
   
    To know the status of this task, perform HTTP `GET` on the `taskmon` URI until the task is complete. If the plugin is added successfully, you will receive an HTTP `200 OK` status code.
   
    After the plugin is successfully added, it will also be available as a manager resource at:
   
       /redfish/v1/Managers
   
    For more information, refer to "Adding a plugin" in the [Resource Aggregator for Open Distributed Infrastructure Management™ API Reference and User Guide](https://github.com/ODIM-Project/ODIM/tree/development/docs).
   
2. To verify that the added plugin is active and running, do the following: 
    1. To get the list of all available managers, perform HTTP `GET` on: 

        `/redfish/v1/Managers` 

        You will receive JSON response having a collection of links to the manager resources. You will see the following links in the collection:

        -   A link to the resource aggregator manager.

        -   Links to all the added plugin managers.

    2. To identify the plugin Id of the added plugin, perform HTTP `GET` on each manager link in the response. 

        The JSON response body for a plugin manager has `Name` as the plugin name.
        Example:
        The JSON response body for the URP plugin manager has `Name` as `URP`.

        **Sample response \(URP manager\)** 

        ```
        {
           "@odata.context":"/redfish/v1/$metadata#Manager.Manager",
           "@odata.etag":"W/\"AA6D42B0\"",
           "@odata.id":"/redfish/v1/Managers/536cee48-84b2-43dd-b6e2-2459ac0eeac6",
           "@odata.type":"#Manager.v1_13_0.Manager",
           "FirmwareVersion":"1.0",
           "Id":"a9cf0e1e-c36d-4d5b-9a31-cc07b611c01b",
           "ManagerType":"Service",
           "Name":"URP",
           "Status":{
              "Health":"OK",
              "State":"Enabled"
           },
           "UUID":"a9cf0e1e-c36d-4d5b-9a31-cc07b611c01b"
        }
        ```
    
3. Check in the JSON response of the plugin manager, if: 
   
    -    `State` is `Enabled` 
    
    -   `Health` is `Ok` 
    
    For more information, refer to "Managers" in [Resource Aggregator for Open Distributed Infrastructure Management™ API Reference and User Guide](https://github.com/ODIM-Project/ODIM/tree/development/docs).
    	

# Use cases for Resource Aggregator for ODIM

## Adding a server into the resource inventory

To add a server, perform HTTP `POST` on the following URI with the request payload having details such as:

-   The BMC address \(IP address or hostname\)

-   The username and password of the BMC user account

-   A link to the connection method having the details of the plugin of your choice


**URI:**
`/redfish/v1/AggregationService/Actions/AggregationSources`


Before adding a server, generate a certificate for it using the root CA certificate of Resource Aggregator for ODIM. To use your own root CA certificate to generate a certificate, you must first [append it to the existing root CA certificate](#appending-ca-certificates-to-the-existing-root-ca-certificate).


<blockquote>
NOTE: To add a server using FQDN, add the server IP address and FQDN under the "etcHostsEntries" parameter in the "kube_deploy_nodes.yaml" file on the deployment node and run the following command:

```
python3 odim-controller.py --config \
/home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml \
--upgrade configure-hosts
```

</blockquote>
This action discovers information about a server and performs a detailed inventory of it. After successful completion, you will receive an aggregation source Id of the added BMC. Save it as it is required to identify it in the resource inventory later.


After the server is successfully added as an aggregation source, it will also be available as a computer system resource at `/redfish/v1/Systems/` and a manager resource at `/redfish/v1/Managers/`.

For more information such as curl command, sample request, and sample response, see "Adding a server" in [Resource Aggregator for Open Distributed Infrastructure Management™ API Reference and User Guide](https://github.com/ODIM-Project/ODIM/tree/development/docs).


## Viewing the resource inventory

To view the collection of servers available in the resource inventory, perform HTTP `GET` on the following URI:

For more examples, see [Postdeployment operations](#postdeployment-operations).

# Postdeployment operations

This section lists all the operations that you can perform after successfully deploying Resource Aggregator for ODIM. You can perform these operations to modify or upgrade the existing Kubernetes deployment.

<blockquote>NOTE: The operations listed in this section are not mandatory.
</blockquote>

## Scaling up the resources and services of Resource Aggregator for ODIM

Following are the two ways of scaling up the resources and services of Resource Aggregator for ODIM deployed in a Kubernetes cluster:

-    Horizontal scaling:
     It involves adding one or more worker nodes to the existing three-node cluster.

     <blockquote>
     NOTE: Scaling of a one-node cluster is not supported—you cannot add nodes to a one-node cluster.
     </blockquote>
 -   Vertical scaling:
     It involves creating multiple instances of the resource aggregator and plugin services.
     <blockquote>
     NOTE:Scaling of third-party services is not supported.
     </blockquote>
1. Log in to each cluster node and update all the configuration files inside `/opt/nginx/servers` with the new node details. 

    <blockquote>NOTE: Refer the existing node entries and add the new node entry. </blockquote>
    
2. Update the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file with the new node details being added.

3. To add a node, run the following command on the deployment node: 

    ```
    python3 odim-controller.py --addnode kubernetes --config \
    /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
    ```

    Before adding a node, ensure that time on the node is same as the time on all the other existing nodes. To know how to set time sync, see [Setting up time sync across nodes](#setting-up-time-sync-across-nodes).

4. To scale up the resource aggregator services, run the following command on the deployment node: 

    ```
    python3 odim-controller.py --config \
    /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml \
    --scale --svc <service_name> --replicas <replica_count>
    ```

5. Replace `<service_name>` with the name of the service which you want to scale up. To know all the complete list of supported deployment and service names, see [Resource Aggregator for ODIM deployment names](#resource-aggregator-for-odim-deployment-names).

    Please note, you can scale up only the `account-session`, `aggregation`, `api`, `events`, `fabrics`, `managers`, `systems`, `tasks`, `update`, `telemetry`and `all` services. 
    Replacing `<service_name>` with `all` will scale up all resource aggregator services.

6. Replace <`replica_count>` with an integer indicating the number of service instances to be added.

7. To scale up the plugin services, run the following command on the deployment node: 

    ```
    python3 odim-controller.py --config \
    /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/\
    kube_deploy_nodes.yaml --scale --plugin <plugin_name> --replicas <replica_count>
    ```

8. Replace `<plugin_name>` with the name of the plugin whose service you want to scale up.
    For example: `urplugin`, `grfplugin`, `dellplugin`, `lenovoplugin`, `aciplugin`

9. Replace `<replica_count>` with an integer indicating the number of plugin service instances to be added.

## Scaling down the resources and services of Resource Aggregator for ODIM

Scaling down involves removing one or more worker nodes from an existing three-node cluster where the services of Resource Aggregator for ODIM are deployed.

<blockquote>NOTE: You cannot remove controller nodes in a cluster.</blockquote>

1. To remove a node, do the following: 
    1. Open the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file on the deployment node.
    
    2. Remove all the node entries under nodes except for the node that you want to remove.
    
    3. Run the following command:
    
        ```
        python3 odim-controller.py --rmnode kubernetes --config \
        /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
        ```
    
2. To scale down the resource aggregator services, run the following command on the deployment node: 

    ```
    python3 odim-controller.py --config \
    /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml \
    --scale --svc <service_name> --replicas <replica_count>
    ```

3. Replace `<service_name>` with the name of the service which you want to scale up. To know all the complete list of supported deployment and service names, see [Resource Aggregator for ODIM deployment names](#resource-aggregator-for-odim-deployment-names).

    Please note, you can scale down only the `account-session`, `aggregation`, `api`, `events`, `fabrics`, `managers`, `systems`, `tasks`, `update`, `telemetry`and `all` services. 
    Replacing `<service_name>` with `all` will scale down all resource aggregator services.

4. Replace `<replica_count>` with an integer indicating the number of service instances to be removed.

5. To scale down the plugin services, run the following command on the deployment node: 

    ```
    python3 odim-controller.py --config \
    /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml \
    --scale --plugin <plugin_name> --replicas <replica_count>
    ```

6. Replace `<plugin_name>` with the name of the plugin whose service you want to scale down.
   For example: `urplugin`, `grfplugin`, `dellplugin`, `lenovoplugin`, `aciplugin`
   
7. Replace `<replica_count>` with an integer indicating the number of plugin service instances to be removed.

## Rolling back to an earlier deployment revision

Rolling back the deployment of Resource Aggregator for ODIM to a particular revision restores the configuration manifest of that version.

1. To list the revision history of the deployment of Resource Aggregator for ODIM, run the following command: 

    ```
    python3 odim-controller.py --config \
    /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml --list \
    history --dep <deployment_name>
    ```

    Replace <deployment\_name\> with the name of the deployment for which you want to list the revision history. To know all the supported deployment names, see [Resource Aggregator for ODIM deployment names](#resource-aggregator-for-odim-deployment-names).

    You will receive a list of revisions along with the revision numbers.

2. To roll back the deployment of Resource Aggregator for ODIM to a particular revision, run the following command: 

    ```
    python3 odim-controller.py --config \
    /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml --rollback \
    --dep <deployment_name> --revision <revision_number>
    ```
	
## Upgrading the Resource Aggregator for ODIM deployment

Upgrading the Resource Aggregator for ODIM deployment involves:

-   Updating the services of Resource Aggregator for ODIM to a new release.

-   Updating the configuration parameters of Resource Aggregator for ODIM.


<blockquote>

# Contributing to the open source community

Welcome to the GitHub open-source community for Resource Aggregator for ODIM!

If you want to contribute to the project to make it better, your help is welcome and highly appreciated. 
Contribution is a great way of extending the understanding and value of open-source software and development models, towards a common goal. Apart from learning more about social coding on GitHub, new technologies and their ecosystems, you can keep the discussion forums active by sharing knowledge, asking right questions, finding information through effective collaborations as well as make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests, and the noblest of all contributions—a good, clean pull request (PR).
All bugs or feature requests must be submitted through a PR to the development branch and are expected to have unit tests and/or integration tests with the PR. 

## Creating a PR

<blockquote>Prerequisite: Follow the project's contribution instructions, if any. </blockquote>

1.	Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub.
2.	Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on GitHub is called origin.
3.	Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
4.	If you created your fork a while ago, be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
5.	Create a new branch to work on. Branch from development (if it exists), else from the main branch.
6.	Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
7.	Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
8.	If the project has tests, run them!
9.	Write or adapt tests as needed.
10.	Add or change the documentation as needed.
11.	Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch, if necessary.
12.	Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, the remote origin.
13.	From your fork, open a PR in the correct branch. Target the project's development branch if there is one, else go for main.
14. Once the pull request is approved and merged, pull the changes from upstream to your local repository and delete your extra branch(es).

    Last, but not the least, **always write your commit messages in the present tense**. Your commit message should describe what the commit is, when is it applied, and what it does to the code – not what you did to the code.

## Running curl commands on a different server	

To run curl commands on a different server, perform the following steps to provide the `rootCA.crt` file.

1. Navigate to the path specified for the odimCertsPath parameter in the kube\_deploy\_nodes.yaml file on the deployment node.
2. Copy the `rootCA.crt` file.

3. Log in to your server and paste the `rootCA.crt` file in a folder.

4. Open the `/etc/hosts` file to edit.

5. Scroll to the end of the file, add the following line, and then save:

   ```
   <hostvm_ipv4_address> <FQDN>
   ```

6. Check if curl is working by using the following command:

   ```
   curl --cacert rootCA.crt 'https://{odim_host}:{port}/redfish/v1'
   ```

<blockquote> NOTE: 
- To avoid using the `--cacert` flag in every curl command, add `rootCA.crt` in the `ca-certificates.crt` file available in this path: `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`. You can access the base URL using a REST client. To access it using a REST client, add the rootCA.crt file of Resource Aggregator for ODIM to the browser where the REST client is launched.</blockquote>

## Using your own CA certificates and keys

1. Generate the following certificates and store them in a folder on the deployment node:

   - odimra_rsa.private: It must be generated only once before deploying the resource aggregator and plugin services.

   - odimra_rsa.public: It must be generated only once before deploying the resource aggregator and plugin services.

     <blockquote>
     NOTE: Ensure not to replace the RSA public and private keys. Replacing them results in loss of data and requires reinstallation. If you are generating your own CA certificates to replace the existing CA certificates, move the existing odimra\_rsa.public and odimra\_rsa.private files to the folder where you are generating all the other certificates.
     </blockquote>

   - rootCA.crt: Root CA certificate.

   - odimra_server.crt: Certificate to be used by the API gateway and the resource aggregator and plugin components.

   - odimra_server.key: Private key to be used by the API gateway and the resource aggregator and plugin components.

   - odimra_kafka_client.crt: Kafka certificate.

   - odimra_kafka_client.key: Kafka key.

   - kafka.keystore.jks: Keystore of type `jks` used by Kafka servers for TLS-based communication.

   - kafka.truststore.jks: Truststore of type `jks`. It contains CA certificates, used by Kafka server to validate certificates of the client that is contacting the Kafka server.

   - zookeeper.keystore.jks: Keystore of type `jks` used by Zookeeper for TLS-based communication.

   - zookeeper.truststore.jks: Truststore of type `jks`. It contains CA certificates, used by Zookeeper to validate certificates of the client that is contacting it.

   While generating these certificates:

   - Ensure that `odimra_server.crt` has the SAN entry of FQDN specified in the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file.

   - Ensure that `odim_server.crt` and `odim_kafka_client.crt` have the following SAN entries for all the plugins you want to deploy.

     Examples: `grfplugin: grfplugin,grfplugin-events`.

   - Ensure that `kafka.truststore.jks` and `kafka.truststore.jks` have the following SAN entries:

     ```
     DNS.1 = kafka
     DNS.2 = kafka1.kafka.${​​​​ODIMRA_NAMESPACE}​​​​.svc.cluster.local
     DNS.3 = kafka2.kafka.${​​​​ODIMRA_NAMESPACE}​​​​.svc.cluster.local
     DNS.4 = kafka3.kafka.${​​​​ODIMRA_NAMESPACE}​​​​.svc.cluster.local
     DNS.5 = kafka-ext
     DNS.6 = kafka1-ext
     DNS.7 = kafka2-ext
     DNS.8 = kafka3-ext
     ```

   - Ensure that `zookeeper.truststore.jks` and `zookeeper.truststore.jks` have the following SAN entries:

     ```
     DNS.1 = zookeeper
     DNS.2 = zookeeper1.zookeeper.${​​ODIMRA_NAMESPACE}​​.svc.cluster.local
     DNS.3 = zookeeper2.zookeeper.${​​ODIMRA_NAMESPACE}​​.svc.cluster.local
     DNS.4 = zookeeper3.zookeeper.${​​ODIMRA_NAMESPACE}​​.svc.cluster.local
     ```

   Replace {​​ODIMRA_NAMESPACE} with the value specified for namespace in the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file.

2. Update `odimCertsPath` with the path of the folder where you have stored the certificates in the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file.

3. **\[Optional\]** Perform this step only after you have successfully deployed the resource aggregator and plugin services.

If you want to replace the existing CA certificates, run the following command:

```
python3 odim-controller.py --config \
/home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml --upgrade odimra-secret
```

**Result**: The existing certificates are replaced with the new certificates and the resource aggregator pods are restarted.

## Regenerating certificates

### Updating Kafka password and certificate

1. Open the ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml file on the deployment node: 

    ```
    vi ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
    ```

2. Update the `kafkaJKSPassword` property with the new password and save. 

    <blockquote>
    NOTE:You might want to store this password for later—if there is a rollback, use the stored password.
    </blockquote>
    Kafka JKS password is updated and Kafka certificate and key are regenerated.

3. Regenerate Kafka JKS along with the certificate and key: 

    Move the following files from the path mentioned in `odimCertsPath` property in the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file to a different folder:

    -   kafka.keystore.jks

    -   kafka.truststore.jks


4. Update Kafka secret: 

    ```
    python3 odim-controller.py --config \
    /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml --upgrade kafka-secret
    ```

    Kafka secret is updated and Kafka pods are restarted.

### Updating Zookeeper password and certificate

1. Open the `~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file on the deployment node: 

    ```
    vi ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
    ```

2. Update the `zookeeperJKSPassword` property with the new password and save. 

    <blockquote>
    NOTE:You might want to store this password for later—if there is a rollback, use the stored password.
    </blockquote>
    Zookeeper JKS password is updated and Zookeeper certificate and key are regenerated.

3. Regenerate Zookeeper JKS along with the certificate and key: 

    Move the following files from the path mentioned in `odimCertsPath` property in the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file to a different folder:

    -   zookeeper.keystore.jks

    -   zookeeper.truststore.jks


4. Update Zookeeper secret: 

    ```
    python3 odim-controller.py --config \
    /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml --upgrade zookeeper-secret
    ```

    Zookeeper secret is updated and Zookeeper pods are restarted.

### Updating certificates with SAN entries

To update the `odimra-server.crt` and `odimra_kafka_client.crt` files, do the following:

<blockquote>NOTE: You cannot update `odimra_rsa.private` and `odimra_rsa.public.</blockquote>

1. To add new entries in `odimra-server.crt`: 
    1. Open the ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml file on the deployment node: 

        ```
        vi ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
        ```

    2. Add the new IP and FQDN SANs to the `odimraServerCertIPSan` and `odimraServerCertFQDNSan` parameters respectively and save. 

        ```
        odimraServerCertIPSan: 1.1.1.1,<new_IP>
        odimraServerCertFQDNSan: odim1.com,<new_FQDN>
        ```

    3. Move `odimra_server.key` and `odimra_server.crt` stored in the path specified for odimCertsPath to a different folder. 

2. To add new entries in `odimra_kafka_client.crt`: 
    1. Add the new IP and FQDN SANs to the `odimraKafkaClientCertIPSan` and `odimraKafkaClientCertFQDNSan` parameters respectively and save. 

        ```

## Resource Aggregator for ODIM default ports

Default ports used by the resource aggregator, plugins, and third-party services can be found in the table in the [Adding a plugin into the Resource Aggregator for ODIM framework](#adding-a-plugin-into-the-resource-aggregator-for-odim-framework) section.



## Deploying the GRF plugin

**Prerequisites**

Kubernetes cluster is set up and the resource aggregator is successfully deployed.

1. Create a directory called `plugins` on the deployment node.
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/plugins
   ```

3. In the `plugins` directory, create a directory called `grfplugin`.
   ```
   mkdir ~/plugins/grfplugin
   ```
   
3. On the deployment node, copy the GRF configuration file and the hook script to `~/plugins/grfplugin`.

    ```
    cp ~/ODIM/odim-controller/helmcharts/grfplugin/grfplugin-config.yaml ~/plugins/grfplugin
    ```

    ```
    cp ~/ODIM/odim-controller/helmcharts/grfplugin/grfplugin.sh ~/plugins/grfplugin
    ```

4. Open the GRF plugin configuration YAML file. 

    ```
    vi ~/plugins/grfplugin/grfplugin-config.yaml
    ```

    **Sample grfplugin-config.yaml file:**

    ```
    grfplugin:
      eventListenerNodePort: 30081
      rootServiceUUID: 65963042-6b99-4206-8532-dcd085a835b1
      username: admin
      password: "UUFCYFpBoHh6UdvytPzm65SkHj5zyl73EYVNJNbrFeAPWYrkpTijGB9zrVQSbbLv052HK7-7chqDQQcjgWf7YA=="
      lbHost: <Ngnix_virtual_IP_address>
      lbPort: <Ngnix_plugin_port>
      logPath: /var/log/grfplugin_logs
    ```
    
    Other parameters have default values. Optionally, you can modify them according to your requirements. To know more about each parameter, see [Plugin configuration parameters](#plugin-configuration-parameters).
    
5. Update the following parameters in the plugin configuration file:

   - **lbHost**: IP address of the cluster node where the GRF plugin will be installed for one node cluster configuration.  For three node cluster configuration,  \(haDeploymentEnabled is true\), lbHost is the virtual IP address configured in Nginx and Keepalived.
   - **lbPort**: Default port is 30081 for one node cluster configuration. For three node cluster configuration, \(haDeploymentEnabled is true\), lbport must be assigned with a free port (preferably above 45000) available on all cluster nodes. This port is used as nginx proxy port for the plugin.

     <blockquote>Note: The lbport is used as proxy port for eventlistenernodeport, which is used for subscribing to events.</blockquote>
   - **grfPluginrootServiceUUID**: RootServiceUUID to be used by the GRF plugin service. Generate a new UUID by executing the command `uuidgen`.

   Other parameters can have default values. Optionally, you can update them with values based on your requirements. For more information on each parameter, see [Plugin configuration parameters](#plugin-configuration-parameters).

6. Generate the Helm package for the GRF plugin on the deployment node.

   1. Navigate to `odim-controller/helmcharts/grfplugin`.
      ```
      cd ~/ODIM/odim-controller/helmcharts/grfplugin
      ```
      
   2. Run the following command to create `grfplugin` Helm package at `~/plugins/grfplugin`:
      
      ```
      helm package grfplugin -d ~/plugins/grfplugin
      ```
      
      The Helm package for the GRF plugin is created in the tgz format.

7. Save the GRF plugin Docker image on the deployment node at `~/plugins/grfplugin`.

    ```
    docker save grfplugin:3.0 -o ~/plugins/grfplugin/grfplugin.tar
    ```

8. Navigate to the `ODIM` directory.

    ```
    cd ODIM
    ```

9. Copy the proxy configuration file `install/templates/grfplugin_proxy_server.conf.j2` to `~/plugins/grfplugin`.

    ```
    cp install/templates/grfplugin_proxy_server.conf.j2 ~/plugins/grfplugin
    ```

    **Important**: Do NOT change the value of any parameter in this file. 

10. Navigate to the `/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts` directory on the deployment node.

    ```
     cd ~/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts
    ```

11. Open the kube\_deploy\_nodes.yaml file to edit.

       ```
      vi kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
       ```

12. Specify values for the following parameters in the `kube_deploy_nodes.yaml` file: 

    | Parameter                    | Value                                                        |
    | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | connectionMethodConf         | The connection method associated with the GRF plugin:<br/> ConnectionMethodVariant: `Compute:BasicAuth:GRF_v1.0.0`<br/>Check if it is there already before updating. If yes, do not add it again.<br/> |
    | odimraKafkaClientCertFQDNSan | The FQDN to be included in the Kafka client certificate of Resource Aggregator for ODIM for deploying the GRF plugin:grfplugin, grfplugin-events<br/>Add these values to the existing comma-separated list.<br/> |
    | odimraServerCertFQDNSan      | The FQDN to be included in the server certificate of Resource Aggregator for ODIM for deploying the GRF plugin: grfplugin, grfplugin-events. <br />Add these values to the existing comma-separated list.<br> |
    | odimPluginPath               | The path of the directory where the GRF Helm package, the `grfplugin` image, and the modified `grfplugin-config.yaml` are copied. |
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    odimPluginPath: /home/bruce/plugins
        odimra:
          groupID: 2021
          userID: 2021
          namespace: odim
          fqdn:
          rootServiceUUID:
          haDeploymentEnabled: True
          connectionMethodConf:
          - ConnectionMethodType: Redfish
            ConnectionMethodVariant: Compute:BasicAuth:GRF_v1.0.0
          odimraKafkaClientCertFQDNSan: grfplugin,grfplugin-events
          odimraServerCertFQDNSan: grfplugin,grfplugin-events
    ```
    
13. Move odimra_kafka_client.key, odimra_kafka_client.crt, odimra_server.key and odimra_server.crt stored in odimCertsPath to a different folder.

      <blockquote>NOTE: odimCertsPath is the absolute path of the directory where certificates required by the services of Resource Aggregator for ODIM are present. Refer to the "Odim-controller configuration parameters" section in this document for more information on odimCertsPath. </blockquote>

14. Update odimra-secrets:

       ```
     python3 odim-controller.py --config /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml --upgrade odimra-secret
       ```

15. Run the following command:

      /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts\
      /kube_deploy_nodes.yaml --upgrade odimra-config
       ```

16. Run the following command to install the GRF plugin: 
      ```
      python3 odim-controller.py --config \
      /home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts\
      /kube_deploy_nodes.yaml --add plugin --plugin grfplugin
      ```

17. Run the following command on the cluster nodes to verify the GRF plugin pod is up and running: 

       ```
      kubectl get pods -n odim
       ```

      Example output showing the GRF plugin pod details:

       ```
      NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
      grfplugin-5fc4b6788-2xx97 1/1 Running 0 4d22h
       ```

--remove plugin --plugin <plugin_name>
```


## Uninstalling the resource aggregator services

To remove all the resource aggregator services, run the following command: 

```
python3 odim-controller.py --reset odimra --config \
/home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml
```

To uninstall all the resource aggregator services by ignoring any errors you may encounter, use the following command:

```
python3 odim-controller.py --reset odimra --config \
/home/${USER}/ODIM/odim-controller/scripts/kube_deploy_nodes.yaml \
--ignore-errors
```

# CI process

GitHub action workflows, also known as checks, are added to the ODIM repository. They are triggered whenever a Pull Request (PR) is raised against the master (development) branch. The result from the workflow execution is then updated to the PR.

<blockquote>
NOTE: You can review and merge PRs only if the checks are passed.
</blockquote>

Following checks are added as part of the CI process:

| Sl No. | Workflow Name           | Description                                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | `build_unittest.yml`    | Builds and runs Unit Tests with code coverage enabled.       |
| 2      | `build_deploy_test.yml` | Builds, deploys, runs sanity tests, and uploads build artifacts (like odimra logs). |

These checks run in parallel and take approximately 9 minutes to complete.

## GitHub action workflow details

1. build_unittest.yml
   - Brings up a Ubuntu 20.04 VM hosted on GitHub infrastructure with preinstalled packages mentioned in the link: https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/master/images/linux/Ubuntu1804-README.md
   - Installs Go 1.17.2 package
   - Installs and configures Redis 6.2.6 with two instances running on ports 6379 and 6380
   - Checks out the PR code into the Go module directory
   - Builds/compiles the code
   - Runs the unit tests
2. build_deploy_test.yml
   - Brings up a Ubuntu 20.04 VM hosted on GitHub infrastructure with preinstalled packages mentioned in the link: https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/master/images/linux/Ubuntu1804-README.md
   - Checks out the PR code
   - Builds and deploys the following docker containers:
     - ODIMRA 
     - Generic Redfish plugin 
     - Unmanaged Rack Plugin 
     - Kakfa 
     - Zookeeper 
     - etcd
     - Redis
   - Runs the sanity tests
   - Prepares build artifacts
   - Uploads the build artifacts

> **NOTE:** Build status notifications having a link to the GitHub Actions build job page will be sent to the developer’s email address.

# Using protoc compiler

The protoc compiler provides a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for defining communications protocols together with gRPC framework for communicating with Resource Aggregator for ODIM services. You can install the compiler, and create and compile your own protocols to the existing code.

1. Install the protoc compiler by performing the following tasks:

   1. Download the protoc compiler package:

      ```
   wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.19.1/protoc-3.19.1-linux-x86_64.zip -P /tmp/'
      ```
   
   2. Install unzip (if not already installed):
   
      ```
      sudo apt install unzip
      ```
   
   4. Unzip the the protoc compiler package to the `proto_files` directory: 
   
      ```
      unzip /tmp/protoc-3.19.1-linux-x86_64.zip -d proto_files
      ```
   
   5. Navigate to the `bin` directory in the `proto_files` directory:
   
      ```
      cd proto_files/bin
      ```
   
   6. Copy `protoc` from this `bin` directory to `/usr/bin`:
   
      ```
      sudo cp protoc /usr/bin
      ```
   
   7. Navigate to the `include` directory in the `proto_files` directory:
   
      ```
      cd ../include
      ```
   
   8. Run the following command:
   
      ```
      sudo cp -r google /usr/local/include/
      ```
   
2. Install `protoc-gen-go` and `protoc-gen-go-grpc` plugins using the following commands:

   ```
   go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
   ```

   ```
   go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go@v1.3.2
   ```

3. Create proto go stub files by performing the following tasks:

   1. Navigate to the ODIM source path and create script file as `generate_proto.sh`.

   2. Add the following content to it:
   
      ```
      #!/bin/bash -x
      ## Generting protoc
      
      protos=("account" "aggregator" "auth" "chassis" "events" "fabrics" "managers" "role" "session" "systems" "task" "telemetry" "update" "compositionservice" "licenses")
      for str in ${protos[@]}; do
      proto_path="$repoFolder/lib-utilities/proto/$str"
      proto_file_name="$str.proto"
      if [ $str == 'auth' ]
      then
      proto_file_name="odim_auth.proto"
      fi
      protoc --go_opt=M$proto_file_name=./ --go_out=plugins=grpc:$proto_path --proto_path=$proto_path $proto_file_name
      done
      ```
   
   3. Run the script file:
   
      ```
      bash ./generate_proto.sh
      ```
