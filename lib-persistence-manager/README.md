# lib-persistence-manager  

lib-persistence-manager is a library that provides an interface for Redis communication.  
Connection interface creates a connection pool, which will be used to interact with the Redis to perform CRUD operation.  
## Indexing  
lib-persistence-manager uses the Redis secondary index for indexing the resources to support search and filter capability. Currently in Resource Aggregator for ODIM, BMC subordinate resources, Events, and Device subscriptions are indexed.
