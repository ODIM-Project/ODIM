# Dell-plugin  

Dell plugin communicates with Redfish compliant BMC.  
This is an independent module that provides two primary communication channels:  
- An API mechanism that is used to exchange control data  
- An Event Message Bus (EMB) that is used to exchange event and notifications.


This guide provides a set of guidelines for developing API and EMB functions to work within the Resource Aggregator for ODIM™ environment. It ensures consistency around API semantics for all plugins.



## Dell plugin deployment instructions

For deploying the Dell plugin and adding the plugin to the Resource Aggregator for ODIM framework, see the *Deploying the Dell plugin* section in the *[Resource Aggregator for Open Distributed Infrastructure Management™ Readme](https://github.com/ODIM-Project/ODIM/blob/development/README.md)*.
