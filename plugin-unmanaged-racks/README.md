# Unmanaged Racks Plugin (URP) 

This folder contains implementation of Unamanaged Racks Plugin(URP) for ODIMRA. 
Plugin exposes narrowed obligatory REST API described by Plugin Developer’s Guide (PDG).
In addition URP exposes following REST endpoints:

* `GET /ODIM/v1/Chassis`—Returns collection of unmanaged Chassis(RackGroups/Racks)
* `GET /ODIM/v1/Chassis/{id}`—Returns instance of unmanaged Chassis(RackGroups/Racks)
* `POST /ODIM/v1/Chassis`*—Creates new unmanaged Chassis(RackGroups/Racks) 
* `DELETE /ODIM/v1/Chassis/{id}`—Deletes existing unmanaged Chassis(RackGroups/Racks)
* `PATCH /ODIM/v1/Chassis/{id}`—Updates existing unmanaged Chassis(RackGroups/Racks)

Full specification of URP is available here: *https://wiki.odim.io/display/HOME/Plugin+for+Unmanaged+Racks*.

Please be aware this plugin is still under development, and some features might be missing.
