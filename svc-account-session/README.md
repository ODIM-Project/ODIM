# Sessions

A session represents a window of user's login with a Redfish service and contains details about the user and the user activity. You can run multiple sessions simultaneously.

Resource Aggregator for ODIM offers Redfish `SessionService` interface for creating and managing sessions. It exposes APIs to achieve the following:

-   Fetching the `SessionService` root

-   Creating a session

-   Listing active sessions

-   Deleting a session

##  Modifying Configurations of Session and Account Service
  
Config File of ODIMRA is located at: **odimra/lib-utilities/config/odimra_config.json**  
Refer the section **Modifying Configurations** in the README.md to change the configurations of a odimra service
  
**Specific configurations for Session and Account Service are:**
  
##  Log Location of the Session and Account Service
  
/var/log/ODIMRA/account_session.log

```
curl -i GET \
              'https://{odimra_host}:{port}/redfish/v1/SessionService'

 ```
 
 
> Sample response body

```
{
   "@odata.type":"#SessionService.v1_1_6.SessionService",
   "@odata.id":"/redfish/v1/SessionService",
   "Id":"Sessions",
   "Name":"Session Service",
   "Status":{
      "State":"Enabled",
      "Health":"OK"
   },
   "ServiceEnabled":true,
   "SessionTimeout":30,
   "Sessions":{

   }
}
```

|---------|---------------|
|**Method** | `GET` |
|**URI** |`/redfish/v1/SessionService` |
|**Description** |Schema representing the Redfish `SessionService` root.|
|**Returns** |The properties for the Redfish `SessionService` itself and links to the actual list of sessions.|
|**Response Code** |`200 OK` |
|**Authentication** |No|






##  Creating a session

```
curl -i POST \
   -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
   -d \
'{
"UserName": "{username}",
"Password": "{password}"
}' \
 'https://{odimra_host}:{port}/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions'

 ```

|||
|---------|---------------|
|**Method** | `POST` |
|**URI** |`/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions` |
|**Description** |This operation creates a session to implement authentication. Creating a session allows you to create an `X-AUTH-TOKEN` which is then used to authenticate with other services.<br>**NOTE:**<br>It is a good practice to note down the following:<br><ul><li>The session authentication token returned in the `X-AUTH-TOKEN` header.</li><li>The session Id returned in the `Location` header and the JSON response body.</li></ul><br> You will need the session authentication token to authenticate subsequent requests to the Redfish services and the session Id to log out later.|
|**Returns** |<ul><li> An `X-AUTH-TOKEN` header containing session authentication token.</li><li>`Location` header that contains a link to the newly created session instance.</li><li>The session Id and a message in the JSON response body saying that the session is created.</li></ul> |
|**Response Code** |`201 Created` |
|**Authentication** |No|



> Sample request body

```
{
"UserName": "abc",
"Password": "abc123"
}
```





###  Request URI parameters

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|UserName|String \(required\)|UserName of the user account for this session. For the first time, use the username of the default administrator account \(admin\). Later, when you create other user accounts, you can use the credentials of those accounts to create a session.<br>**NOTE:**<br> This user must have `Login` privilege.|
|Password|String \(required\)<br> |Password of the user account for this session. For the first time, use the password of the default administrator account. Later, when you create other user accounts, you can use the credentials of those accounts to create a session.<br> |
