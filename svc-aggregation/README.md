#  Resource aggregation and management

The resource aggregator allows you to add southbound infrastructure into its inventory, create resource collections, and perform actions in combination on these collections. It exposes Redfish aggregation service endpoints to achieve the following:

-   Adding a resource and building its inventory.

-   Resetting one or more resources.

-   Changing the boot path of one or more resources to default settings.

-   Removing a resource from the inventory which is no longer managed.


All aggregation actions are performed as [tasks](#tasks) in Resource Aggregator for ODIM. The actions performed on a group of resources \(resetting or changing the boot order to default settings\) are carried out as a set of subtasks.

|<strong>URI</strong> |`/redfish/v1/AggregationService/AggregationSources` |
|<strong>Description</strong> | This operation creates an aggregation source for a Base Management Controller \(BMC\), discovers information, and performs a detailed inventory of it.<br> The `AggregationSource` schema provides information about a BMC such as the IP address, the username, the password, and more.<br> This operation is performed in the background as a Redfish task.<br> |
|<strong>Returns</strong> |<ul><li>`Location` URI of the task monitor associated with this operation in the response header. See `Location` URI highlighted in bold in "Sample response header \(HTTP 202 status\)".</li><li>Link to the task and the task Id in the sample response body. To get more information on the task, perform HTTP `GET` on the task URI. See "Sample response body \(HTTP 202 status\)".</li><li>On successful completion:<ul><li>The aggregation source Id, the IP address, the username, and other details of the added BMC in the JSON response body.</li><li>A link \(having the aggregation source Id\) to the added BMC in the `Location` header. See `Location` URI highlighted in bold in "Sample response header \(HTTP 201 status\)".</li></ul></li></ul>|
|<strong>Response Code</strong> |On success, `202 Accepted` On successful completion of the task, `201 Created` <br> |
|<strong>Authentication</strong> |Yes|

**Usage information**

Perform HTTP POST on the mentioned URI with a request body specifying a connection method to use for adding the BMC. To know about connection methods, see [Connection methods](#connection-methods).
				
A Redfish task will be created and you will receive a link to the [task monitor](#viewing-a-task-monitor) associated with it.

To know the progress of this operation, perform HTTP `GET` on the task monitor returned in the response header (until the task is complete).
When the task is successfully complete, you will receive aggregation source Id of the added BMC. Save it as it is required to identify it in the resource inventory later.

After the server is successfully added as an aggregation source, it will also be available as a computer system resource at `/redfish/v1/Systems/` and a manager resource at `/redfish/v1/Managers/`.

To view the list of links to computer system resources, perform HTTP `GET` on `/redfish/v1/Systems/`. Each link contains `ComputerSystemId` of a specific BMC. For more information, see [Collection of computer systems](#(#collection-of-computer-systems)).

 `ComputerSystemId` is unique information about the BMC specified by Resource Aggregator for ODIM. It is represented as `<UUID:n>`, where `UUID` is the aggregation source Id of the BMC. Save it as it is required to perform subsequent actions such as `delete, reset`, and `setdefaultbootorder` on this BMC.


**NOTE:**

Only a user with `ConfigureComponents` privilege can add a server. If you perform this operation without necessary privileges, you will receive an HTTP `403 Forbidden` error.

## Aggregates

An aggregate is a user-defined collection of resources.

The aggregate schema provides a mechanism to formally group the southbound resources of your choice. The advantage of creating aggregates is that they are more persistent than the random groupings—the aggregates are available and accessible in the environment of Resource Aggregator for ODIM until you delete them.

The resource aggregator allows you to:

-   Create an aggregate.

-   Populate an aggregate with the resources.

-   Perform actions on all the resources of an aggregate at once.

-   Delete an aggregate.
