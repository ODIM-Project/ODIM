# Events

Resource Aggregator for ODIM offers an event interface that allows northbound clients to interact and receive notifications such as alerts and alarms from multiple resources, including Resource Aggregator for ODIM itself. It exposes Redfish `EventService` APIs for managing events.

An event is a way of asynchronously notifying the client of some significant state change or error condition, usually of a time critical nature.

Use these APIs to subscribe a northbound client to southbound events by creating a subscription entry in the service.

**Supported endpoints**

## Creating an event subscription

|||
|-----------|-----------|
|**Method** | `POST` |
|**URI** |`/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions` |
|**Description**| This endpoint subscribes a northbound client to events originating from a set of resources \(southbound devices, managers, Resource Aggregator for ODIM itself\) by creating a subscription entry. For use cases, see [Subscription use cases](#event-subscription-use-cases).<br>This operation is performed in the background as a Redfish task. If there is more than one resource that is sending a specific event, the task is further divided into subasks.|
|**Returns** |<ul><li>`Location` URI of the task monitor associated with this operation in the response header.</li><li> Link to the task and the task Id in the sample response body. To get more information on the task, perform HTTP `GET` on the task URI. See "Sample response body \(HTTP 202 status\)".<br>**IMPORTANT:**<br> Note down the task Id. If the task completes with an error, it is required to know which subtask has failed. To get the list of subtasks, perform HTTP `GET` on `/redfish/v1/TaskService/Tasks/{taskId}`.</li><li>On success, a `Location` header that contains a link to the newly created subscription and a message in the JSON response body saying that the subscription is created. See "Sample response body \(HTTP 201 status\)".</li></ul>|
|**Response code** |<ul><li>`202 Accepted`</li><li>`201 Created`</li></ul>|
|**Authentication** |Yes|


**Usage**


To know the progress of this action, perform HTTP `GET` on the [task monitor](#viewing-a-task-monitor) returned in the response header \(until the task is complete\).

To get the list of subtask URIs, perform HTTP `GET` on the task URI returned in the JSON response body. See "Sample response body \(HTTP 202 status\)". The JSON response body of each subtask contains a link to the task monitor associated with it. To know the progress of this operation \(subtask\) on a specific server, perform HTTP `GET` on the task monitor associated with the respective subtask.


>**NOTE:**
Only a user with `ConfigureComponents` privilege is authorized to create event subscriptions. If you perform this action without necessary privileges, you will receive an HTTP`403 Forbidden` error.

|-----------|-----------|
|**Method** | `POST` |
|**URI** |`/redfish/v1/EventService/Actions/EventService.SubmitTestEvent` |
|**Description** | Once the subscription is successfully created, you can post a test event to Resource Aggregator for ODIM to check whether you are able to receive events. If the event is successfully posted, you will receive a JSON payload of the event response on the client machine \(destination\) that is listening to events. To know more about this event, look up the message registry using the `MessageId` received in the payload. See "Sample message registry \(Alert.1.0.0\)". For more information on message registries, see [Message registries](#message-registries). |
|**Response code** |`200 OK` |

**Request parameters** 

|Parameter|Value|Attributes|Description|
|---------|-----|----------|-----------|
|EventGroupId|Integer|Optional|The group Id for the event.|
|EventId|String|Optional|The Id for the event to add. This Id is a string of a unique positive integer. Generate a random positive integer and use it as the Id.|
|EventTimestamp|String|Optional|The date and time stamp for the event to add. When the event is received, it translates as the time the event occurred.|
|EventType|String \(enum\)|Optional|The type for the event to add. For possible property values, see "EventType" in [Creating an event subscription](#creating-an-event-subscription).|
|Message|String|Optional|The human-readable message for the event to add.|
|MessageArgs \[ \]|Array \(string\)|Optional|An array of message arguments for the event to add. The message arguments are substituted for the arguments in the message when looked up in the message registry. It helps in trouble ticketing when there are bad events. For example, `MessageArgs` in "Sample event payload" has the following two substitution variables:<br><ul><li>`EthernetInterface 1`</li><li>`/redfish/v1/Systems/{ComputerSystemId}`</li></ul><br>`Description` and `Message` values in "Sample message registry" are substituted with the above-mentioned variables. They translate to "A LAN Disconnect on `EthernetInterface 1` was detected on system `/redfish/v1/Systems/{ComputerSystemId}.` |
|MessageId|String|Required|The Message Id for the event to add. It is the key used to find the message in a message registry. It has `RegistryPrefix` concatenated with the version, and the unique identifier for the message registry entry.

The message registry mentioned in the sample request payload is `Alert.1.0`.|
|OriginOfCondition|String|Optional|The URL in the `OriginOfCondition` property of the event to add. It is not a reference object. It is the resource that originated the condition that caused the event to be generated. For possible values, see "Origin resources" in [Creating an event subscription](#creating-an-event-subscription).|
|Severity|String|Optional|The severity for the event to add. For possible values, see "Severity" table.|

To get notified whenever a new resource is added in Resource Aggregator for ODIM, subscribe to `ResourceAdded` event originating from any collection \(Systems, Chassis, Fabrics\). 

To create this subscription, perform HTTP `POST` on `/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions` with the sample request payload:

To get notified whenever an existing resource is removed from Resource Aggregator for ODIM, subscribe to `ResourceRemoved` event originating from any collection \(Systems, Chassis, Fabrics\). 

To create this subscription, perform HTTP `POST` on `/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions` with the sample request payload:



### Subscribing to task status notifications


> Task status notification payload

```
{ 
   ​   "Name":"EventSubscription",
   ​   "Destination":"https://{Valid_destination_IP_Address}:{Port}/EventListener",
   ​   "EventTypes":[ 
      "StatusChange"

            }     ​
   ]   ​
}​
```

There are two ways of checking the task completion status in Resource Aggregator for ODIM: keep polling a task until its completion or simply subscribe to an event notification for task status change \(to receive changes in the task status asynchronously\).

To get notified of the task completion status, subscribe to `StatusChange` event on `/redfish/v1/TaskService/Tasks`. To create this subscription, perform HTTP `POST` on `/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions` with the sample request payload:
